      Every decade since 1992, Sight and Sound has complemented its celebrated critics’ poll by formally sounding out the world’s leading directors on the ten films they believe to be the greatest of all time.

      Though it has always been global and inclusive in scope, the poll has expanded significantly each decade. In 1992, 101 directors voted; fast-forward to 2012, when 358 filmmakers took part. This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world. In every case, the voter is a director of note.

      Here are the 100 greatest films of all time, as voted for by many of today’s greatest living filmmakers."/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="robots" content="index, follow"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#783df6"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="msapplication-TileImage" content="/dist/server/a67a7d9041d0ee52635dff7f0110378e.png"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="msapplication-config" content="/browserconfig.xml"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" name="theme-color" content="#ffffff"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" property="og:type" content="website"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" property="og:site_name" content="BFI"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" property="og:url" content="/sight-and-sound/directors-100-greatest-films-all-time"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" property="og:title" content="Directors’ 100 Greatest Films of All Time"/><meta data-react-helmet="true" property="og:description" content="

      <p>Every decade since 1992, Sight and Sound has complemented its celebrated critics’ poll by formally sounding out the world’s leading directors on the ten films they believe to be the greatest of all time.</p>

      <p>Though it has always been global and inclusive in scope, the poll has expanded significantly each decade. In 1992, 101 directors voted; fast-forward to 2012, when 358 filmmakers took part. This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors. This electorate spans experimental, arthouse, mainstream and genre filmmakers from around the world. In every case, the voter is a director of note.</p>

      <p>Here are the 100 greatest films of all time, as voted for by many of today’s greatest living filmmakers.</p></p><div class="Text__Outer-sc-1wo6lq-0 kdTWTr text_block">

In 1992, 101 directors voted; fast-forward to 2012, when 358 filmmakers took part. This year, for the fourth edition of the poll, we received ballots from 480 directors.

Like the heroine of Hans Christian Andersen’s source fairytale, whose magic shoes compel her to dance, Victoria Page – played by real-life ballerina Moira Shearer – finds herself driven to breaking point by obsessive Russian impresario Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) when she’s cast in his ballet The Red Shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its captivating behind-the-scenes insight into the creative process, and characters for whom art is more important than life itself, the film has proved an inspiration to filmmakers and dancers alike. For writer-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it represented a triumphant attempt to create a ‘composed film’ in which music – here by Brian Easdale – plays a more central role, demanding similar expressive intensity in every detail of design and performance. Fittingly, it won Oscars for both art direction and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s hard to think of many films that match The Red Shoes for ferocity and passion, since in every costume, set, and streak of grease paint there is desire. Moira Shearer’s performance as an ambitious ballerina is a tour de force. Jack Cardiff ’s moody colour work takes on a life of its own on screen. And the cinematography in the surreal extended dance sequence is breathtaking.

It is one of the medium’s most unforgettable images of isolation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The iconic image of Ethan Edwards framed in the doorway, the expanse of the West stretching behind him, is as lyrical as it is telling. A relic of the past, he cannot cross over the threshold into the civilised world. He has helped to preserve a world he cannot be a part of any longer. Racist and unyielding, Ethan is not likeable and his redemption seems impossible.

Loach’s relaxed direction of a cast that includes ex-wrestler Brian Glover and future Chariots of Fire writer Colin Welland is as impressive as the unsentimental tenderness with which he depicts Billy’s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Kes in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Ken Loach","producer":"Tony Garnett","writer":"","featuring":"Dai Bradley, Freddie Fletcher, Lynne Perrie"},"year":"1969","nameAndYear":" Kes (1969)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"United Kingdom","runningTime":113,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":72,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"4e863895-0eb6-56b0-a218-73079fb5f057","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-02/a-separation-2011-payman-maadi-sareh-bayat-through-glass-door.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-02/a-separation-2011-payman-maadi-sareh-bayat-through-glass-door.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-02/a-separation-2011-payman-maadi-sareh-bayat-through-glass-door.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-02/a-separation-2011-payman-maadi-sareh-bayat-through-glass-door.jpg","altText":null},"name":"A Separation","url":"/film/4e863895-0eb6-56b0-a218-73079fb5f057/a-separation","summary":null,"fullDescription":"<p>Find out who voted for A Separation in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Asghar Farhadi","producer":"Asghar Farhadi","writer":"Asghar Farhadi","featuring":"Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini"},"year":"2011","nameAndYear":"A Separation (2011)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-a-separation-2011-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-a-separation-2011-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15453","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"Iran","runningTime":122,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":72,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"be5e9c53-bbdb-5316-a1a5-43ea2772fe49","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-09/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom-1975-voyeur.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-09/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom-1975-voyeur.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-09/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom-1975-voyeur.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-09/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom-1975-voyeur.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom","url":"/film/be5e9c53-bbdb-5316-a1a5-43ea2772fe49/sal-or-the-120-days-of-sodom","summary":{"text":"Pier Paolo Pasolini’s controversial adaptation of the Marquis de Sade’s novel, relocated to Benito Mussolini’s fascist republic.","html":"<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini’s controversial adaptation of the Marquis de Sade’s novel, relocated to Benito Mussolini’s fascist republic.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini’s final work, a controversial transposition of the Marquis de Sade’s novel to Benito Mussolini’s fascist republic of 1944, may prove too strong for some, with its explicit scenes of the humiliation and torture of young men and women by a group of wealthy, sadistic libertines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Salò or The 120 Days of Sodom in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","producer":"Alberto Grimaldi","writer":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","featuring":"Paolo Bonacelli, Giorgio Cataldi, Uberto P.

Three years after the deep-space horror of Alien (1979), Ridley Scott imagined an urban future to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The ghost of Raymond Chandler’s bygone LA haunts its story of a Marlowe-like former detective (Harrison Ford) assigned to track down escaped ‘replicants’ – biologically engineered beings employed as slaves by their human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a critical and commercial flop, Blade Runner developed a huge cult following. Countless science-fiction blockbusters have tried to replicate it, but Scott’s original retains an unrepeatable intrigue in the central ambiguity of Deckard’s own identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Science-fiction cinema is transformed forever in the furnace of production design.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Blade Runner distils the iconographies of dystopian science-fiction and transmogrifies them to produce the blueprint for seemingly every example of the genre to follow.

Its original Thai title, Sud Pralad, in fact means something like ‘strange beast’. This is perhaps a more apt characterisation of a film that compels through fierce natural strangeness rather than intimations of illness per se. More is going on here in terms of story, sense perception, sexuality, identity and spirituality than is easily accessible to mainstream sensibilities. But if that speaks to malady, it seems less a matter of infection or disease than the disordered expectation that the world will constrain itself to conventionally limited and contingent ways of thinking, feeling and understanding. Strange beasts are best met on their own ground, on their own terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is a diptych of sorts. The first part introduces us to soldier Keng (Banlop Lomnoi), part of a group assigned to a rural area where unsettling killings of animals have been noted, perhaps the work of an unquiet spirit – the strange beast. There, Keng meets Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee), a placid-seeming young man with whom he strikes up a flirtatious rapport. They spend time together in town and country, at the movies, taking a dog to the vet, exploring nearby shrines. In the second part, Keng is in the forest, alone, tracking and being tracked by the strange spirit, who seems to be at once Tong and a tiger. There are stalkings, struggles and submissions, encounters with ghost cows and clever monkeys. In both parts, transportive sound design and locked-off compositions frame interpersonal dynamics&nbsp;that tilt in unexpected ways. Queerness here is not only a matter of same-sex desire but of radical uncertainty, shifts between persons and worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a work that defies straightforward understanding and suggests that understandability may be overrated. (Benedict Anderson has argued that aspects of narrative, setting and character unfamiliar to the film’s cosmopolitan audiences are quite accessible to viewers from the region where the film was shot – yet even they were perplexed by other elements.) Apichatpong’s earlier features had won festival recognition but this was a breakthrough. In the years since, its calm indifference to staid forms of logic, hierarchy and desire have helped affirm it as a marvel of imaginative engagement with posthuman possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben Walters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Tropical Malady in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","producer":"Charles de Meaux","writer":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","featuring":"Banlop Lomnoi, Sakda Kaewbuadee, Sirivech Jareonchon"},"year":"2004","nameAndYear":"Tropical Malady (2004)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"France, Thailand, Germany, Italy, Switzerland","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":62,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"67205871-c042-50a8-879d-d9b1992ef8d1","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2020-09/satantango-1994-trio-walking-down-wet-path.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2020-09/satantango-1994-trio-walking-down-wet-path.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2020-09/satantango-1994-trio-walking-down-wet-path.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2020-09/satantango-1994-trio-walking-down-wet-path.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Sátántangó","url":"/film/67205871-c042-50a8-879d-d9b1992ef8d1/stntang","summary":{"text":"As timely as ever in its grim poeticisation of demagogues and doom, helplessness and hope.

Certainly, it soon would, in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) and many later films noirs. That affiliation was first proposed by J. Hoberman in the 1970s. But Meshes has been invoked as seminal by many traditions over eight decades. For years, this 14-minute film was claimed as a founding inspiration of a distinctively American form of highly personal poetic psychodrama, typified by Stan Brakhage, who hailed Deren as “the mother of us all”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deren’s hands-on promotion of her work became a model for the co-operative movement of the 1960s. Rising interest in women’s cinema would later refocus attention on her pioneering role. Today, she is the only woman among seven experimental filmmakers featured on the front page of the New York Filmmakers Co-op website, while the haunting image of her at a window must be one of the most widely reproduced stills from any avant-garde film. And rising interest in women’s film after the 1970s would focus attention on her aesthetic of ‘vertical cinema’, creating an emotional and intellectual density within rather than between images, as Barbara Hammer has described it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Deren and her co-director Alexander Hammid (originally Hackenschmied) were immigrants from Eastern Europe. She came from a Jewish family background in Ukraine, heavily involved in psychiatry, and he from experimental photography and film in Czechoslovakia. Deren would indignantly reject suggestions of influence from two earlier European avant-garde landmarks, Buñuel and Dalí’s Un chien andalou (1928) and Cocteau’s The Blood of a Poet (Le Sang d’un poète, 1930). But for all its cool originality, the eerie game of repeated symbols that its maker-protagonists play out in their West Hollywood home and garden – with a flower, key and knife linking Deren’s divided self and a sinister mirror-faced figure – has undoubtedly extended the legacy of those earlier works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meshes has never reached the top 100 before in the S&amp;S poll (despite some interesting previous backers, such as Derek Jarman in 1992). So this year’s result must reflect some significant shifts in taste – most obviously the recognition of female creativity apparent in the poll leaders, but perhaps also a renewed interest in the phantasmagoric, as explored by Deren’s most consistent fans among contemporary filmmakers, the David Lynch of Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr., and Jordan Peele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ian Christie</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Meshes of the Afternoon&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Maya Deren, Alexander Hackenschmied","producer":"","writer":"","featuring":null},"year":"1943","nameAndYear":"Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":62,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"797ab4f5-e457-5b07-9ca6-63d347f7da5a","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2020-08/late-spring-1949-women-by-well.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2020-08/late-spring-1949-women-by-well.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2020-08/late-spring-1949-women-by-well.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2020-08/late-spring-1949-women-by-well.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Late Spring","url":"/film/797ab4f5-e457-5b07-9ca6-63d347f7da5a/late-spring","summary":{"text":"The first of Yasujirō Ozu’s great cycle of dramas that place the joys and sadnesses of family life in the context of a Japan disrupted by modernity.","html":"<p>The first of Yasujirō Ozu’s great cycle of dramas that place the joys and sadnesses of family life in the context of a Japan disrupted by modernity.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>“Is this my favourite of the works of the great minimalist Ozu? You can summarise the plot of Late Spring in a couple of lines: the professor (Chishū Ryū) lives happily with his daughter Noriko; her aunt announces Noriko must marry before she is too old; the professor pretends he will marry so Noriko will not feel guilty about leaving him on his own. She marries. Even this is enough to understand that Ozu’s preoccupation with the precarity of happiness frames his greatest works.

When was this immaculate feature film, Agnès Varda’s essay on time and space, love and death, ever not on our minds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving with the first surge of the French New Wave, Cléo from 5 to 7 crackles with the energy and modernity of that cinephile movement, but it’s ultimately an introspective piece, characterised by the philosophical preoccupations of Varda’s Left Bank peers. Corinne Marchand plays Cléo, a blonde pop singer whose vanity relaxes as her anxieties swell. As the film begins, she visits a tarot reader, hoping for good news about the medical test results she is awaiting – but the cards spell only death, and transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Cléo’s mind is fixed on the future, Varda’s camera captures her in the present tense, killing time in Paris as she ponders her own decay. Echoing Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, Varda dissects a trip down the stairs to emphasise the moment as it passes, one we would otherwise have missed. As Cléo, a Parisian Mrs Dalloway, walks the streets of her city, Varda also captures a broader sense of time, an era in history: Paris in the early 1960s, with its crowds, cafés, shops, music, fashion and cinema. The geography is precise: Varda called the film “the portrait of a woman painted on to a documentary about Paris”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film shifts from colour to blackand- white to remind us that this is what cinema does – it transforms life. A film within the film turns the idea into a joke: life makes no sense in monochrome. But Cléo is transformed by the film, by these 90 minutes and the images of herself and her future that confront her everywhere. In real time, Cléo becomes more real, more subject than object, more human, more in tune with the city. She discards her whipped-cream wig and polka dots for a simple black shift. She performs less and feels more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the kind of playfulness that Varda enjoyed so much, we could call this ticking- clock film timeless. From the feminist analysis of a woman’s commodified beauty and a celebrity’s self-regarding narcissism to the vulnerable heroine acting out her messy emotions in public, the spectre of war and the fear of disease darkening a midsummer day, Cléo from 5 to 7 feels pertinent to the modern moment. It always will. Marchand’s Cléo was pinned in a point in time, but the film marches on, playing on a loop in our imaginations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pamela Hutchinson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Cléo from 5 to 7&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Agnès Varda","producer":"Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti","writer":"Agnès Varda","featuring":"Corinne Marchand, Antoine Bourseiller, Dominique Davray"},"year":"1962","nameAndYear":"Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-cleo-from-5-to-7-1962-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-cleo-from-5-to-7-1962-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/14968","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"France, Italy","runningTime":90,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":53,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"909bd4b2-afe0-5a1c-a403-438fe2092eb2","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-02/viridiana-1961-last-supper-re-enactment.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-02/viridiana-1961-last-supper-re-enactment.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-02/viridiana-1961-last-supper-re-enactment.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-02/viridiana-1961-last-supper-re-enactment.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Viridiana","url":"/film/909bd4b2-afe0-5a1c-a403-438fe2092eb2/viridiana","summary":{"text":"In Luis Buñuel’s controversial masterpiece, a novice nun gets more than she bargains for when she turns her dead uncle’s estate into a home for beggars.","html":"<p>In Luis Buñuel’s controversial masterpiece, a novice nun gets more than she bargains for when she turns her dead uncle’s estate into a home for beggars.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Luis Buñuel returned to Spain from a long period of exile in Mexico to make Viridiana, but the result was banned by Franco’s government and denounced by the Vatican as blasphemous.

The film’s ascent almost feels like a given, due to the effervescence that may be its defining characteristic and the scarcity of that quality in our trying times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, typically for anything that seems so effortless, Kelly and Donen’s achievement was in fact the product of an enormous amount of toil and trouble. At the project’s outset, the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green tried and failed to get out of the gig when MGM musical head Arthur Freed ordered them to build a new movie on top of a batch of tunes by Freed and his partner Nacio Herb Brown that were gathering dust. (Indeed, ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ itself had made its screen debut in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.) Debbie Reynolds’ ordeal filming the ‘Good Morning’ tap-dance number famously left her with bloody feet. As for the title song, six months of rehearsal culminated in Gene Kelly gamely splashing about while running a high fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that suffering is discernible on screen, which is one of the many delightful ironies about Hollywood’s most deeply cherished movie about the making of a Hollywood movie. Pulling back the curtain to show yet more dazzling drapery, Comden and Green celebrate an earlier era of Tinseltown chancers and hustlers with a tale of a production caught between the silent and sound eras. Kelly’s plucky hoofer and stuntman-turned-star Don Lockwood leads the charge to retrofit a swashbuckler picture named The Duelling Cavalier to take advantage of the new vogue for sound, with his new sweetie Kathy (Reynolds) being his best means of disguising the squawky voice of his leading lady Lina (a hilarious Jean Hagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several movies besides Don’s latest somehow contained within the text of Singin’ in the Rain (including, if we are to believe the deliciously meta billboard in the final shot, Singin’ in the Rain). Cheekily purporting to reveal its own means of production while still delivering one unabashedly theatrical showstopper after another, Kelly and Donen’s masterwork anticipates the brassy postmodernism of Moulin Rouge! (2001). But like such fellow homage-payers as The Artist (2011) and La La Land (2016), Baz Luhrmann’s rendition feels meagre compared to the original and its seemingly inexhaustible bounty of ingenuity, bravado and sheer unabashed joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Anderson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Singin’ in the Rain&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen","producer":"Arthur Freed","writer":"Adolph Green, Betty Comden","featuring":"Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds"},"year":"1951","nameAndYear":"Singin' in the Rain (1951)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-singin-in-the-rain-1951-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14090","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":102,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":53,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"8fef8d40-97a8-5932-93dc-e01d1dfdcc8f","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/the-mother-and-the-whore-1973-conversation-on-bed.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/the-mother-and-the-whore-1973-conversation-on-bed.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/the-mother-and-the-whore-1973-conversation-on-bed.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/the-mother-and-the-whore-1973-conversation-on-bed.jpg","altText":null},"name":"La Maman et la Putain","url":"/film/8fef8d40-97a8-5932-93dc-e01d1dfdcc8f/la-maman-et-la-putain","summary":null,"fullDescription":"<p>Find out who voted for The Mother and the Whore in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Jean Eustache","producer":"Pierre Cottrell","writer":"Jean Eustache","featuring":"Françoise Lebrun, Bernadette Lafont, Jean-Pierre Léaud"},"year":"1973","nameAndYear":"La Maman et la Putain (1973)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":0,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":46,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"8c6c178c-b903-5e2b-b480-d43a6b21f5b4","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/dont-look-now-1973-donald-sutherland.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/dont-look-now-1973-donald-sutherland.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/dont-look-now-1973-donald-sutherland.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/dont-look-now-1973-donald-sutherland.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Don't Look Now","url":"/film/8c6c178c-b903-5e2b-b480-d43a6b21f5b4/dont-look-now","summary":{"text":"Set in off-season Venice, British director Nicolas Roeg’s tragedy combines an acute study of grief with a supernaturally charged thriller plot, to beautiful and devastating effect.","html":"<p>Set in off-season Venice, British director Nicolas Roeg’s tragedy combines an acute study of grief with a supernaturally charged thriller plot, to beautiful and devastating effect.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Based on Daphne du Maurier’s short story, Don’t Look Now opens with the death of a child, but the tragedy is that of her parents, John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter (Julie Christie).

An adaptation of Davis Grubb’s novel, the film is refined to a lucid allegory. Evil, in the form of fake preacher Robert Mitchum, is visited upon a woman and two innocent children until they’re rescued by Good, in the form of frail Lillian Gish. In its intensely visual treatment of the story it harks back to the great silent films, thanks to former Orson Welles collaborator Stanley Cortez’s marvellously expressive black-and-white cinematography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the former criminal convinced that his executed cellmate’s loot is in the possession of his widow (Shelley Winters) – whom he marries purely in order to get his hands on it – Mitchum was never better: charismatic and charming, vicious and violent, his symbolic ‘duel’ between two sets of tattooed knuckles (‘LOVE’ and ‘HATE’) provided American cinema with one of its indelible images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A mystical slice of Americana noir, this fable about the innate unreliability of adults and the tragic spectrum of human nature sticks in the memory like a stone in the craw. ‘It’s a hard world for the little things.’” <strong>Gemma Files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Night of the Hunter knows just how unsettling the perversion of innocence can be, building on this premise to create a poisoned fairytale. With his only film, Laughton set out to film fear, and he succeeded.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Mitchum was the master of the languid gaze, a couldn’tcare- less attitude that, in Laughton’s hands, made the allure of evil totally understandable. Shelley Winters’ Willa might have been a foolish woman for falling under the spell of the preacher with ‘love’ and ‘hate’ tattooed on his knuckles, but he offered her something otherwise unimaginable in her small Depression-era West Virginian town. Laughton’s masterpiece was immediately dismissed by audience and critics alike: its visual compositions led it to be suspected of artistry, while its refusal to conform to genre was box-office death. The dreamlike sequences of the children’s escape down the river viewed through an enormous spider’s web contrasted with the angular shadows of the light falling into their room, and all pathways lead to Lillian Gish’s final appearance, cradling a gun on the veranda as she waits, singing hymns, for Mitchum to come for his prey.” <strong>Ruth Barton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Laughton’s career-length frustrations at cinema’s expressive limitations are here redeemed. A journey through the heart of darkness, in which heart and dark have equal weight – just as in Laughton’s acting.” <strong>James Swanton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for The Night of the Hunter in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Charles Laughton","producer":"Paul Gregory","writer":"James Agee","featuring":"Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish"},"year":"1955","nameAndYear":"The Night of the Hunter (1955)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":92,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":41,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"a27e52ca-e6b6-5cd4-a2e0-1e1a30456e56","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/playtime-1967-tati-shopfront.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/playtime-1967-tati-shopfront.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/playtime-1967-tati-shopfront.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/playtime-1967-tati-shopfront.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Playtime","url":"/film/a27e52ca-e6b6-5cd4-a2e0-1e1a30456e56/playtime","summary":{"text":"Jacques Tati’s most painstaking accomplishment blends deft slapstick, endless visual ingenuity and sonic comedy in a stupendous modern satire.","html":"<p>Jacques Tati’s most painstaking accomplishment blends deft slapstick, endless visual ingenuity and sonic comedy in a stupendous modern satire.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Filmed on a huge, complex set suggestive of the cool, vaguely dehumanising effects of technology and design on modern life, Jacques Tati’s masterpiece offers a low-key account of the bumbling Hulot’s experiences during one day in Paris.

A film about minor embarrassments and fleeting connections between strangers, it begins in alienation and builds to a transcendent vision of communal harmony. Gruelling labour went into each seemingly effortless grace note, as Tati the performer drifts in aimless bewilderment through the world that Tati the director obsessively controls.

Like Alfred Hitchcock in the same year’s Psycho, Michelangelo Antonioni upturned expectation by getting rid of his film’s ostensible protagonist early on. Unlike Hitchcock, however, Antonioni provided no explanation for this sudden disappearance of his female star, hinting only at the alienation and ennui that the film depicts as a characteristic of contemporary bourgeois society as a potential cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No less radical than this modernistic ambiguity was the Italian master’s controlled use of camera movement and visual composition to dramatise the emotional space between people. The film made a star of Monica Vitti, who plays Claudia, the missing woman’s friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece changed the course of Italian neorealism and arthouse cinema. It injected a healthy dose of entropy into conventions of European cinema, where plot and story lost their preeminence, replaced by the potential of a searching, introverted, filmic gaze.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I first saw L’avventura, at film university, it made me contemplate the idea that a filmmaker could be deliberately obtuse, vague, mystifying, and that it could work so entirely in creating a mood of alienation. Moving on to La notte (1961), Blow-Up (1966) and The Passenger (1975), this was an artist who epitomised the auteurist possibility of a singular cinematic vision structured across an entire body of work. I later saw a documentary on Antonioni in which he described himself as the proponent of the “cinema of miscommunication” – a statement as insightful as it was self-aware. Ironically, his central insight is the modernist breakdown of coherence and unity, in cinema and life. Also, Monica Vitti.” <strong>Dario Llinares</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for L’avventura&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Michelangelo Antonioni","producer":"Amato Pennasilico","writer":"Michelangelo Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, Tonino Guerra","featuring":"Gabriele Ferzetti, Monica Vitti, Lea Massari"},"year":"1960","nameAndYear":"L'avventura (1960)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-lavventura-1960-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-lavventura-1960-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/12839","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"Italy, France","runningTime":144,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":38,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"725ff1e4-895e-5c6e-8a6e-b03825197e99","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-10/la-regle-du-jeu-1939-paulette-dubost.jpg","altText":null},"name":"La Règle du jeu","url":"/film/725ff1e4-895e-5c6e-8a6e-b03825197e99/la-rgle-du-jeu","summary":{"text":"Huge-spirited and sharp-eyed, Jean Renoir’s French-society fresco gathers high classes and low for a weekend of country-house fallout.","html":"<p>Huge-spirited and sharp-eyed, Jean Renoir’s French-society fresco gathers high classes and low for a weekend of country-house fallout.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Made on the cusp of WWII, Jean Renoir’s satire of the upper-middle classes was banned as demoralising by the French government for two decades after its release. Renoir, a director associated with the left wing Popular Front, turned his gaze away from working people to the haute bourgeoisie. Taking its cue from the classic stage farces of Musset and Beaumarchais, Renoir sets his action during a shooting weekend at a country house. It’s an upstairs-downstairs world where servants and masters become enmeshed in a tangle of desire, a jumble of motivations in which, in the film’s famous phrase, “Everyone has their reasons”. At the film’s centre is the amiable Octave (played by Renoir), whose best intentions lead to tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shot in long, controlled takes that stress the depth of vision, Renoir’s depiction of an intransigent society teetering blithely into disaster was derided upon release and only later acclaimed as one of cinema’s most vital films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A lesson in life in every word of dialogue, a piece of cinema in every frame. The joy of seeing a movie was never as great as here.” <strong>João Antunes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A merry-go-round of love and sorrow. A masterful comedy of manners replete with unexpected twists and turns.” <strong>Jan Olsson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A stunning panorama of metropolitan and provincial, aristocrat and peasant, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and a tale of two marriages that seems to sum up life in Europe just before World War II.” <strong>Carrie Rickey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In this film we can find everything: the decadence of European culture before the war, the creative freedom of a film director both modern and primitive, the infinite potential of filming in deep-focus and long shots to grab and replicate the complexity, the openness, the elusiveness of reality.” <strong>Roberto Manassero</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Probably the best example of the Renoir style, combining graceful mise en scène, seamless plotting and the peerless command of cinematic technique.” <strong>Charles Ramírez Berg</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No more devastatingly ironic and subtle critique of wealth, power and privilege has ever been made. A great film by a committed activist filmmaker.” <strong>Ian Aitken</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Luminous, masterful filmmaking with a piercing melancholy.” <strong>Anupama Chopra</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Characters and events move between the foreground, middle ground and background through deep focus and long shots.

One of the world’s great filmmakers, and this is his greatest achievement.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Deceptively light-handed charm throughout the upstairs, downstairs antics in a country house doesn’t obscure Jean Renoir’s contempt for the underlying darkness and his prescience of what was to imminently befall such people.

Punished, maltreated, used, loved, Balthazar is put to work by one keeper after another, bearing silent witness to the folly and petty cruelties of his human masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bresson was a Catholic filmmaker, and his story has been interpreted as a Christian allegory by some critics. The director’s austerely concentrated shots, restricted to details of scenes in order to elucidate the whole, and his controlled use of sound to imply off-screen activity, make for a uniquely dense, richly textured film. Jean-Luc Godard was to suggest that Balthazar contained “the world in an hour and a half”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s minimalist masterpiece brings to life with unequalled power the story of an abused donkey whose depth of suffering illuminates the cruelty of the human world towards other species and humanity’s unexamined belief in its own superiority.” <strong>Barbara Creed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The reverse of Disneyfication: a parable of animal sacrifice and the price of human foibles.” <strong>Barrett Hodsdon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Robert Bresson drafted the rules of a new cinema and realised them in Au hasard Balthazar, his masterpiece. This seemingly aloof, cold film, inspired by a passage in Dostoevsky’s 1868 novel The Idiot, burns with a yearning for justice and beauty. Bresson’s disciplined portraiture of a donkey and the way of life in the French countryside is a lesson in seeing the world anew through the cinema and noticing the potential that endeavour contains.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Few have changed the face of cinema like Bresson, proposing a wholly new understanding of cinematic time, performance, découpage and the fiction/nonfiction dichotomy. Au hasard Balthazar is the finest work to have ever shifted from the human to the non-human and back again.” <strong>Flavia Dima</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bresson’s stillness is a limpid and natural act of consciousness in front of an impassive world.

This narrative-free portrait of city life – three unidentified cities provided the locations – is propelled by an effervescent delight in the possibilities of film, with its unexpected angles and clashing juxtapositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vertov deliberately shunned what he saw as hidebound theatrical conventions such as intertitles and actors – the film’s only real protagonist is the cameraman himself. This could easily be an indulgent mess, but Vertov’s grasp of his medium is so philosophically sure-footed that it’s just as stimulating many decades later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“David Abelevich Kaufman, also known as Dziga Vertov (a Ukrainian phrase roughly meaning ‘spinning top’), was born in 1896 into a Jewish book-dealer’s family in the city of Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, in modernday Poland. He understood Lenin’s philosophy that film was the most important of all the propaganda forms (especially among a largely illiterate population) and his Anniversary of the Revolution (1918), which may be the first documentary ever made, should be studied in every film school. Though none of us have truly experienced Man with a Movie Camera – which has not been seen in its original form since the 1930s due to it being widely replicated and distributed at an inaccurate speed, significantly changing its rhythm and accents in a way that does not match its original score – I’m still dazzled by its artistry and anticipate the forthcoming restoration.” <strong>Dorota Lech</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘Down with bourgeois fairytale plots and scenarios – long live life as it is!’ So said Dziga Vertov, for whom documentary was the only true revolutionary form as it freed film from false scenarios and performing actors. Man with a Movie Camera, about life in a Soviet city from dawn to dusk, was certainly revolutionary in its approach to image creation, which continually undermines and extends itself to dazzling and witty effect.

Based on the record of the 15th-century trial and execution of Joan of Arc, the film focuses on an extraordinarily concentrated central performance from Renée Falconetti, allegedly the result of merciless needling from Dreyer during the filming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous for its spare visual style, Dreyer’s film creates compelling drama from its looming facial close-ups, interspersing the plaintive Joan with the penetrating gazes of her zealous inquisitors. Watching the flickers of anguish and resolve across Falconetti’s features, registered in stark detail by Rudolph Maté’s cinematography, is one of cinema’s most purely moving experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Renée Falconetti gives the most impressive performance ever recorded on film in this silent classic. Carl Theodor Dreyer expanded the potential of the close-up in this chronicle of Joan of Arc’s trial and execution. This “hymn to the triumph of the soul over life”, as Dreyer called it, re-emerges in Vivre sa vie (1962), Jean-Luc Godard’s masterpiece, in which a devastated Anna Karina watches Joan’s pains in a film theatre and cries with her.” <strong>Kaya Genc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s in the last decade that Dreyer’s somehow rapturously austere work of historical cinema shifted from being a film that enthralled me as a scholar to one that fully involved and moved me as a viewer – and of course, finally seeing it in an enveloping cinema environment, rather than a university lecture theatre or my own living room, was the instigating factor. You don’t absolutely need to see every crisply restored pore on Falconetti’s extraordinary face to viscerally feel her pain, but it certainly doesn’t hurt.” <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Simply the best (silent) film about (silent) resistance.” <strong>Anton Dolin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A dream and a nightmare of spiritual ecstasy. Dreyer and his design collaborators create an amalgam of the 14th and 20th centuries, and somehow reach into the future with every stroke. Renée Falconetti’s performance: incomparable, unbeatable, anguished and enough to make an atheist think things over.” <strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A quote from Jean Epstein’s 1921 essay ‘Magnification’ is relevant here: ‘The close-up is an intensifying agent because of its size alone... whatever its numerical value, this magnification acts on one’s feelings more to transform than to confirm them, and personally, it makes me uneasy... The close-up modifies the drama by the impact of proximity. Pain is within reach. If I stretch out my arm I touch you, and that is intimacy. I can count the eyelashes of this suffering. I would be able to taste the tears.‘” <strong>Anne Gjelsvik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Carl Th.

The 124-minute running time contains only 114 shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film focuses on a devout parson and his three sons, the eldest of whom, Mikkel (Emil Hass Christensen), has rejected God altogether, while his sibling Johannes (Preben Lerdorff Rye) has had a breakdown and thinks himself to be Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a 1932 play by Kaj Munk, the material is transformed by Dreyer into uniquely slow, hypnotic cinema that examines the nature of believing.

Robert De Niro famously gained weight to play the out of shape La Motta of later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Raging Bull in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Martin Scorsese","producer":"Irwin Winkler, Robert Chartoff, Peter Savage","writer":"Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin","featuring":"Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty"},"year":"1980","nameAndYear":"Raging Bull (1980)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"USA","runningTime":129,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":22,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"bfbb9ef1-1b2c-58fd-b030-4f50c4827d91","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-03/pather-panchali-1955-child-hole.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-03/pather-panchali-1955-child-hole.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-03/pather-panchali-1955-child-hole.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-03/pather-panchali-1955-child-hole.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Pather Panchali","url":"/film/bfbb9ef1-1b2c-58fd-b030-4f50c4827d91/pather-panchali","summary":{"text":"All the mischief, discoveries, joys and tragedies of life are given endlessly lyrical expression in Satyajit Ray’s debut, the first entry in ‘The Apu Trilogy’.","html":"<p>All the mischief, discoveries, joys and tragedies of life are given endlessly lyrical expression in Satyajit Ray’s debut, the first entry in ‘The Apu Trilogy’.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Bengali film director Satyajit Ray was inspired by the example of Italian neo-realist films such as Bicycle Thieves (1948) to make his own low-budget, open-air drama painting a naturalistic portrait of ordinary lives. Encouraged by Jean Renoir, whom he assisted during the filming of The River (1951), Ray set to work on an adaptation of a 1929 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a young boy growing up in an impoverished rural community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Bimal Roy’s Do Bigha Zamin (1953), Pather Panchali announced the arrival of a humanistic, Calcutta-centred Indian art cinema, distinct from the commercial product of Bollywood. Among the film’s intensely memorable moments is a scene in which Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his sister run through a paddy field to catch a glimpse of a passing train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here is a cinema of awakenings.” <strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A tour de force of humanist cinema, looking at a rural family which faces tragedies as well as stolen moments of happiness and togetherness. The influence of Jean Renoir, coupled with a fierce originality in its black-and-white visuals, still mark it out as the best Indian film ever made – and all achieved at a negligible budget.” <strong>Khalid Mohamed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ray’s classic was hailed internationally as a realist masterpiece but dismissed in India by some eminent citizens (who should have known better) as a film that did nothing but highlight Indian poverty for Western eyes. Looking at it today, you marvel at what Ray pulled off. He had a great sense of design and space, but to have created a film whose every frame captures time and place with such elegance and depth still takes you aback. To me, it is Indian cinema’s first truly modern film, at home in the world.” <strong>Shubhra Gupta</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Pather Panchali&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Satyajit Ray","producer":"","writer":"Satyajit Ray","featuring":"Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Subir Banerjee"},"year":"1955","nameAndYear":"Pather Panchali (1955)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-pather-panchali-1955-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-pather-panchali-1955-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15798","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"India","runningTime":121,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":22,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"784b550c-9db8-568a-8078-32b4957e2bbb","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-03/mulholland-drive-2001-naomi-watts-laura-harring-outside-looking-up.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Mulholland Dr.","url":"/film/784b550c-9db8-568a-8078-32b4957e2bbb/mulholland-dr","summary":{"text":"Hollywood is dark and dangerous, yet alluring, in David Lynch’s acclaimed thriller.","html":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood is dark and dangerous, yet alluring, in David Lynch’s acclaimed thriller.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Defiantly sui generis and unorthodox as he’s always seemed, it may be that David Lynch has by now become a paradigmatic voice of our times. What has long been labelled ‘Lynchian’, instead of merely ruling over our culture’s more delicious margins, might be instead how modern life feels for most of us – a clotted dream of irrational seizures and psychosexual secrets and desires wracked by incomprehensible forces. Certainly, the rise of his crepuscular masterpiece Mulholland Dr. up the new poll’s canonical ladder – 20 rungs, from 28 in 2012 – suggests that we’re coming around to accepting Lynch’s disorienting voice as paradigmatic, even necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having begun as a post-Twin Peaks TV pilot, dumped by ABC and expanded upon into something completely different, Lynch’s film is his gay Anna Karenina (1878), his Hollywood death dive, his final salute to the legacy mysteries of Vertigo (1958) and his deepest dish of metaphysical tragedy. In the deftest of the filmmaker’s gnomic bifurcations, the movie’s flow runs from network-gloss irony, through a tunnel of angst, to a Sapphic wander through Desolation Row, with its two heroines (Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) also doubled up, playing out two contrasting narratives, each potentially and mysteriously the psychic B-side of the other. Identity, in Hollywood, is a quantum reality, a fact that meets Lynch’s lust for instability head on. Perhaps that is the resonating clue as to the film’s ascendant critical regard: its essential, unreasonable slipperiness, its fierce embrace of uncertainty and the indeterminate, speaks more to our fraught present, 21 years later, than it did to its heyday during the pre-9/11 Bush administration. (Not that it wasn’t beloved then, reaping dozens of criticgroup awards and getting Lynch an Oscar nomination for Best Director.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film’s unironic payload of wrenching heartbreak, swimming up from a swampy dream of ironic strangeness, is singular in his oeuvre, as if the vulnerabilities of young women in the twisty roads and dusty hills of the American movie struck him in ways that the dark plight of smalltown Lumberton/ Twin Peaks high-schoolers didn’t quite? Perhaps. But it’s still a maddening, freaky, mysterious thing, seductively interpretable but, ultimately, Lynchianly resistant to final readings. That’s integral to its allure, too. It’s like a hieroglyph you’re always on the verge of translating or a lover’s sphinx-like expression in bed that suggests betrayal, devotion or something in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Michael Atkinson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Mulholland Dr.&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"David Lynch","producer":"Mary Sweeney, Alain Sarde, Neal Edelstein, Michael Polaire, Tony Krantz, Joyce Eliason","writer":"David Lynch","featuring":"Justin Theroux, Naomi Watts, Laura Harring"},"year":"2001","nameAndYear":"Mulholland Dr. (2001)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-mulholland-dr-2001-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rent/14931","pillar":"rentals","price":3.5,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"France, USA","runningTime":146,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":22,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"6f9488ef-f914-594e-b76b-dce7143c8522","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-08/the-battle-of-algiers-1966-men-on-streets-turning-backwards.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-08/the-battle-of-algiers-1966-men-on-streets-turning-backwards.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-08/the-battle-of-algiers-1966-men-on-streets-turning-backwards.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-08/the-battle-of-algiers-1966-men-on-streets-turning-backwards.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"The Battle of Algiers","url":"/film/6f9488ef-f914-594e-b76b-dce7143c8522/the-battle-of-algiers","summary":{"text":"A window on Algeria’s wider liberation war, recreating a violent phase of guerrilla struggle and suppression in powerful free-documentary style.","html":"<p>A window on Algeria’s wider liberation war, recreating a violent phase of guerrilla struggle and suppression in powerful free-documentary style.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>One of the cinema’s great political masterpieces, as important as Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin 40 years earlier, The Battle of Algiers charts the history of Algeria’s national liberation movement from its inception in 1954 to the country’s independence in 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is no dry, detached documentary, however much the grainy black-and-white cinematography makes it look like a newsreel. Individual set-pieces are as gripping as any ever filmed, with Gillo Pontecorvo’s determination to give both sides a fair hearing leading to constant moral ambiguity when both sides commit tit-for-tat atrocities. Although there’s no doubt where the film itself stands (it was independent Algeria’s first production), the most richly drawn character is the French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), aware that he’s on history’s losing side but still required to go through the motions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially banned in France, Pontecorvo’s film has been used as a morale-booster by both the Black Panther movement and the 2010 Algerian World Cup team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Unquestionably the greatest political film ever made, and by such a wide margin that it’s hard to think of an obvious runner-up.

Like the wartime trilogy that Roberto Rossellini began with Rome: Open City (1945), it heralded a new kind of cinematic naturalism, employing non-professionals as actors and taking the camera out onto the streets to faithfully record the social realities of a Europe struggling to get back on its feet after WWII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapted from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, the quiet tragedy of a father’s desperate hunt for a stolen bicycle that he depends on for his work has a fable-like simplicity.

In the late 1970s, emboldened by the critical successes of his two Godfather films, Francis Ford Coppola famously spent a vast amount of time and money in the jungles of Southeast Asia to bring to life the story of an American officer (Martin Sheen), sent up river to bring the wayward, megalomaniac Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troubled production – beset by a typhoon, a heart attack (Sheen’s) and the perils of excess – has entered film-making lore, but the resulting film rivals Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 (1968) for its hallucinatory visuals and grandness of conception. Coppola defined its uniquely unhinged genius best: “My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This raw, ragged Vietnam War epic remains Coppola’s most ambitious and original work. It doesn’t have the classical poise of The Godfather (1972) but offers so much more in its impressionistic, wild-ride, river-road-movie journey, a post-60s version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness (1899).

It’s about agony, misery and the fall of concepts, principles and ideals. All this is achieved with such visual and poetic power.

Strongly influenced by the poetic westerns of John Ford, Kurosawa’s story of farmers recruiting a motley troupe of samurai to help them fend off bandits in turn had a huge impact on subsequent westerns and action films – from Hollywood remake The Magnificent Seven (1961) onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early section’s gathering together of the diversely talented fighters is a trope in action movies to this day, while the restrained use of slow-motion in the frenzied final faceoff has since been abused to far less subtle ends. Kurosawa expertly sustains the suspense over a lengthy duration, instilling the story with an almost Shakespearian grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So ambitious and successful in its ambition that it seems to embody the most exciting aspects of the cinematic medium: epic sweep, not of place but of classes, from samurai to peasant to bandit to outsider; stunning photography that recreates 16th-century Japan, from its beautiful heights (the flower-picking scene) to its muddy depths (the final, agonising battle); wonderful performances, not only by Mifune Toshirō as the intense outsider who yearns to be a samurai, but also by Shimura Takashi as the samurai’s canny, world-weary leader and the finefeatured Miyaguchi Seiji, whom I refer to as Cool Old Guy. And with a moving, indeed shattering finale that suggests the sorrow of war both on the personal and on the historical side.” <strong>Susan Napier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My list is light on epics, in part because depth of character impresses me more than scope. But Kurosawa gives us both.” <strong>Peter Debruge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Exciting and moving, its handling of characters and story makes it maybe the best film school that cinema has to offer.” <strong>Mårten Blomkvist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I was a kid, I watched an episode of the TV programme Movie Masterclass (1988), presented by Mamoun Hassan, that analysed this film’s framing, movement and editing, scene by scene. It blew my mind. Decades on, Kurosawa’s dynamism still leads the way.” <strong>Leigh Singer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because Kurosawa transcended action cinema even as he invented it. Because he made it rain and rain. And because of his gaggle of ohso- human heroes: Shimura, Inaba, Katō, Miyaguchi, Chiaki, Kimura – and Mifune Toshirō like a cat on a hotplate.” <strong>Ian Nathan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seven Samurai reminds us how moving pictures move. The whole film celebrates thrilling energy with compassion and empathy for the underprivileged.” <strong>Peggy Chiao</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The intricacy, ferocity and poignancy of Seven Samurai enable it to define a genre.” <strong>Katie Smith-Wong</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa is Eisenstein’s principal heir and the genius of Japanese cinema.” <strong>Joan Mellen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The eastern to top all westerns. Kurosawa’s absolute highlight and a film to be studied in terms of blending the exterior and the interior, the grand and the small, the there-and-then and the timeless.” <strong>Andrei Liimets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sixty-eight years after its release, Kurosawa’s masterpiece still defines everything that I want an action film to possess – a meaningful story with deep characterisations, beautiful shots and purposeful action, and a rhythm that immerses me in its every moment. There are very few action films that achieve this tapestry and Seven Samurai remains the best of them all.” <strong>Richard Propes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kurosawa’s samurai epic marked a peak in the influential Japanese filmmaker’s most critically appreciated period. Together with star Mifune Toshirō, theirs was a collaboration which produced 17 years of films that belong in any catalogue of the greatest films ever made.” <strong>Tambay Obenson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where would cinema be without Kurosawa Akira?” <strong>James Harrison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Seven Samurai in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Akira Kurosawa","producer":"Sojiro Motoki","writer":"Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni, Akira Kurosawa","featuring":"Takashi Shimura, Toshiro Mifune, Seiji Miyaguchi"},"year":"1954","nameAndYear":"Seven Samurai (1954)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-seven-samurai-1954-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-seven-samurai-1954-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/62","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"Japan","runningTime":200,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":14,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/beau-travail-1999-embrace.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Beau travail","url":"/film/bc9dc6fa-0761-553d-8324-f1fbd4bd2005/beau-travail","summary":{"text":"Claire Denis’s great gift is to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition.

My face split into a grin of disbelief as the credits rolled and I rewound the final scene. More than 20 years after its initial release, that set piece, soundtracked by Corona’s 90s Eurodance hit ‘The Rhythm of the Night’, with its climactic burst of feeling, is as well-known as the film itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started as a sort of joke. Claire Denis was commissioned by the TV network Arte to make a film about foreignness and so, wryly, provocatively, she made a movie in which her own people were the foreigners. In Marseille, Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant) reflects on his time as ‘a perfect legionnaire’ in Djibouti, East Africa, serving the French Foreign Legion. He and his soldiers, including the undeniably pretty and unusually well-liked Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin), perform highly choreographed military drills in the desert heat. Under the blazing sun, resentments simmer. In the evenings, the men dance at a nightclub with the local women, who are beautiful, modern and ambivalent. Djibouti, a former French colony, gained independence in 1977. These soldiers are irrelevant; the colonial project is obsolete. ‘Unfit for life, unfit for civilian life’ is how Galoup describes himself in his diary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But feeling unmoored from one’s purpose – feeling like a foreigner to your own life – is a timeless conundrum, and one that seems to resonate with both film lovers and filmmakers (Barry Jenkins has mentioned its influence on 2016’s Moonlight). It remains Denis’s only true crowd-pleaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denis’s great gift is her ability to evoke emotion with gesture and juxtaposition. In the Djibouti desert, water shimmers and ripples, naked shoulders perspire and black mosquito nets recall sheer lingerie. In a Claire Denis film, dialogue is sparse, but images are charged with meaning. ‘Making films, for me, is to get rid of explanation,’ she told the Guardian back in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final scene is pure release: a wordless explanation after 90 minutes of tension. Visual references travel through quotations in other works and, in recent times, through the internet. Films are portioned up and divorced from their original contexts, re-appropriated and shared as memes. I wonder if the renewed popularity of Beau travail in this decade’s Greatest Films poll is a result of its increased visibility among a younger generation, many of whom have likely encountered, or at least revisited, its euphoric dancefloor-set conclusion via their computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Simran Hans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Beau Travail&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Claire Denis","producer":"Jérôme Minet, Patrick Grandperret","writer":"Jean-Pol Fargeau, Claire Denis","featuring":"Denis Lavant, Michel Subor, Grégoire Colin"},"year":"1998","nameAndYear":"Beau travail (1998)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-beau-travail-1998-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-beau-travail-1998-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15787","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"France","runningTime":93,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":12,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"7232754d-299f-5b3c-9c4e-f1758809c8ed","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/barry-lyndon-1975-family-greeting-in-reading-room.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/barry-lyndon-1975-family-greeting-in-reading-room.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/barry-lyndon-1975-family-greeting-in-reading-room.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/barry-lyndon-1975-family-greeting-in-reading-room.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Barry Lyndon","url":"/film/7232754d-299f-5b3c-9c4e-f1758809c8ed/barry-lyndon","summary":{"text":"Stanley Kubrick’s meticulously designed epic recounts the picaresque exploits of an 18th-century Irish adventurer.","html":"<p>Stanley Kubrick’s meticulously designed epic recounts the picaresque exploits of an 18th-century Irish adventurer.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Following the collapse of his long-gestating Napoleon project, Stanley Kubrick turned to this lesser-known novel by the author of Vanity Fair, set at the time of the Seven Years War.

Close-Up is often seen not only as a turning-point in the Iranian’s career – it cemented his confidence in blurring the distinction between ‘documentary’ and ‘fiction’ – but as the film most representative of his aims and achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could have been a straightforward record of the court case of an unemployed print worker accused of impersonating filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf with the intent of fraudulently obtaining money from a well-to-do family. But in relating the story of Hossein Sabzian’s encounter with the Ahankhahs, Kiarostami characteristically opts for anything but an obvious linear narrative. Mixing 16mm footage of the trial (in which Kiarostami himself seems to ask as many questions as the judge) with recreations of events performed by the family, Sabzian and others playing themselves, he fragments the story into diverse meandering strands that frequently frustrate expectations while still remaining intelligible and engrossing. ‘Important’ events may be left unseen; in their place, sequences in which nothing of any clear consequence happens. Re-enactments occur without giving away whose point of view they represent. The more ‘information’ we’re offered about the case, the more we come to realise that there are no easy answers to any of the questions being raised. The plot thickens – except that we do, eventually, understand that the accused, for all his strange, seemingly unmotivated deceptions, is undoubtedly a decent human being, worthy of our attention, sympathy and respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though formally inventive, Close-Up confirms that its creator is no formalist. The film is driven both by deep, unsentimental compassion and by genuine philosophical curiosity; it explores the fraught relationships between truth and falsehood, film and ‘reality’, intention and action, and acknowledges, from start to finish, the role and responsibility of the director in his engagement with the people in his film. Also admirably typical of Kiarostami’s best work is his admission – indeed, insistence – that the film is incomplete until viewers respond by engaging with its artifice and actively using their imaginations. For Kiarostami, the unshown, the unsaid, the unknown were crucially important; meaning was inextricably linked to mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Close-Up in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Abbas Kiarostami","producer":"","writer":"Abbas Kiarostami","featuring":"Hossein Sabziyan, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abolfazl Ahankhah"},"year":"1989","nameAndYear":"Close-up (1989)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"Iran","runningTime":100,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":9,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"1b8c3bcb-842f-5ba2-90ee-39b6b40b7c21","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-01/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-maggie-cheung-against-wall-with-tony-leung.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-01/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-maggie-cheung-against-wall-with-tony-leung.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-01/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-maggie-cheung-against-wall-with-tony-leung.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-01/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-maggie-cheung-against-wall-with-tony-leung.jpg","altText":null},"name":"In the Mood for Love","url":"/film/1b8c3bcb-842f-5ba2-90ee-39b6b40b7c21/in-the-mood-for-love","summary":{"text":"Wong Kar Wai’s masterpiece is a heartbreaking story of illicit love that pulses with the ache of repressed desire.","html":"<p>Wong Kar Wai’s masterpiece is a heartbreaking story of illicit love that pulses with the ache of repressed desire.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>The signs were already there that Wong Kar Wai’s woozy, hungry, love story was likely to earn a significant promotion in this year’s poll. Ten years ago, it stood out as the best-performing film of the 21st century in the critics’ list, landing in 24th place. With a fresh generation of critics chiming in – one that cinematically came of age when Wong’s film had already attained modern-classic status – it was sure to rise up the ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Mood for Love’s spectacular top five placement, however, demonstrates the broadly seductive allure of a mid-century Hong Kong period piece that looks both forward and back, wallowing in nostalgia for a purer, lusher form of cinematic romanticism while carving out more modern, even avant-garde forms of sensual and psychological expression from its saturated style. It’s a film that invites you to think, “They don’t make them like they used to” – even though you know they never quite made them quite like this. The film’s essential romantic narrative of forbidden yearnings and missed connections may be the stuff of vintage melodrama, but less familiar is the way Wong expands the simple anatomy of a thwarted love affair into an elastic meditation on personal unrest, political statelessness and the violence of time’s unrelenting passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film never tells you it’s about any of that, of course. Wong’s porous, often headily non-verbal filmmaking trusts us to feel the lovers’ ennui and melancholy – and further, to identify it within ourselves – via its sheer accumulation of sounds, images and sense memories: be it the damp wraiths of steam swirling from an opened noodle container, the warm, vinyl-roughened croon of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack or the impossible lobby-card beauty of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, both preserved here in their ravishing prime, and somehow convincing as ordinary mortals made movie-star beautiful by love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re living through a fairly stifled age of visual storytelling, as the televisual pull of streaming culture encourages filmmakers to think smaller and more literal. As moving as its relationship study is, anybody who thinks of In the Mood for Love, however, thinks first of those sensory flourishes and grace notes – it’s a film that even, somehow, has a signature scent. Its visual and sonic fragments cumulatively evoke not just a firmly past time and place but a mood, a feeling, a sorrow that drifts from the film’s world to ours. That must account for its enduring, even increasing, popularity: it lingers like an unrequited crush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for In the Mood for Love&nbsp;in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Wong Kar Wai","producer":"Wong Kar Wai","writer":"Wong Kar Wai","featuring":"Maggie Cheung Man-yuk, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Rebecca Pan Di-hua"},"year":"2000","nameAndYear":"In the Mood for Love (2000)","links":{"player":"","southbank":""},"player":null,"performances":[],"channels":[],"productionCountries":"Hong Kong, France","runningTime":98,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":9,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"d58fc7f8-fd9a-5f17-88e8-c87f27856486","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2021-07/persona-1966-liv-ullmann-bibi-andersson-head-shots.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Persona","url":"/film/d58fc7f8-fd9a-5f17-88e8-c87f27856486/persona","summary":{"text":"Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory filmmaking.","html":"<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory filmmaking.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Ingmar Bergman’s Persona can be seen as the apex of his cinematic career – at one point in the film, even the celluloid itself appears to burn up in the projector, as if there was nowhere further to go. Like his Italian counterpart Fellini, Bergman achieved fame in European art cinema in the 1950s and early 60s but unexpectedly made his masterpiece out of a creative crisis. After the collapse of a project focusing on two actresses, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann (who both had intimate relationships with the director), Bergman spent time in hospital, where he came up with a fresh idea. Struck by the women’s physical likeness, he planned to explore questions of identity through the encounter between a great stage actress (Ullmann) who has inexplicably fallen silent and the insecure, garrulous nurse (Andersson) assigned to look after her. Secluded on the barren island of Fårö (which became Bergman’s favourite location and main home), the protagonists – both brilliantly played – engage in a battle of wills, their divergent attitudes towards sex and motherhood merging in disturbing ways. The erotic intensity and rawness of Persona was challenging in 1966, and remains so – few film ‘classics’ still feel so modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any sense of a conventional psychodrama is constantly disrupted by the experimental, improvisatory nature of the filmmaking. Bergman begins the film with a violent, fractured opening montage illustrating the nature of cinema itself and keeps ratcheting up the ambiguities by blurring realism and fantasy. Self-reflexivity never seemed so seductive, as the film freely plays with ideas of public masks and inner secrets, vampirism physical and metaphysical, and the fine line between screen performance and real lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persona has virtually defined the outer reaches of subsequent ‘art’ cinema, influencing visionary directors from Robert Altman and Nicolas Roeg to David Lynch and Olivier Assayas. Its iconography has become pervasive – Andersson’s cool blackrimmed sunglasses, the haunting images of the two women facing the camera, all beautifully rendered in the velvety monochrome photography of Sven Nykvist. The film’s overtly Jungian aspects and slippery narrative have provoked many questions and debates; Bergman gave little away, preferring audiences to draw their own conclusions. He followed Persona with some great films, but nothing quite as audacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David Thompson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Persona in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Ingmar Bergman","producer":"","writer":"Ingmar Bergman","featuring":"Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Margareta Krook"},"year":"1966","nameAndYear":"Persona (1966)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-persona-1966-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15480","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"Sweden","runningTime":81,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":8,"tied":false,"film":{"uuid":"97341aa7-c937-57bf-9011-99bb084472b9","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2022-11/mirror-1975-woman-looking-out.jpeg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2022-11/mirror-1975-woman-looking-out.jpeg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2022-11/mirror-1975-woman-looking-out.jpeg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2022-11/mirror-1975-woman-looking-out.jpeg","altText":null},"name":"Mirror","url":"/film/97341aa7-c937-57bf-9011-99bb084472b9/mirror","summary":{"text":"Cinema scaled new heights of visual poetry in this deeply personal, elliptical film by the master of ‘sculpting in time’.","html":"<p>Cinema scaled new heights of visual poetry in this deeply personal, elliptical film by the master of ‘sculpting in time’.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>Andrei Tarkovsky drew on memories of a rural childhood before WWII for this personal, impressionistic and unconventional film poem. For perhaps his most daring experimentation with film structure, Andrei Tarkovsky intersperses scenes from three eras – a childhood in the countryside, the Great War, and post-war maturity – to create a prismatic reflection of his own life and those of his parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abandoning linear narrative in favour of dramatising discontinuous shards of memory (particularly relating to his mother Maria, played by Margarita Terekhova), Tarkovsky pioneered a poetic and richly allusive form.

After the popular and critical success of his state-of-the-nation paparazzi drama La dolce vita (1960), Federico Fellini found himself at an artistic impasse.

Of all the films that could surmount this poll (there have now been four, across eight decades), it seems apt that Alfred Hitchcock’s woozy psychoromance should lose its grip as soon as it reached the summit – that this delirious maunder with James Stewart’s acrophobic, impressionable detective through an absurd murder-seduction intrigue in a winding San Francisco wonderland should place less steadily than the obdurate Citizen Kane (1941), previously enshrined on high for 40 years. Still, its fall has been less steep than that of Bicycle Thieves (1948), which sank from first to seventh between 1952 and 1962, or this year’s plunge of Jean Renoir’s La Règle du jeu (1939), previously a top-ten perennial, from fourth to 13th. Vertigo came just seven votes short of the top spot – proportionally closer than in 2002, when it missed deposing Orson Welles’s reigning champ by only four votes – while the distance between it and Kane (now third) has grown since 2012, from 34 votes to 45. This is not a film in rapid descent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of last year, Vertigo’s 1958 release date puts it in the first half of cinema’s history. As that history extends, and this poll grows, so the greater diversity of latter-day filmmaking stretches the voting. In 2012 the film led with 191 votes – meaning it was included in almost a quarter of the entries; this year its 208 votes amounted to half that proportion, 12 per cent. Lifting the lid of the poll, though, shows a more fluid story than just new voters moving on from the old. Vertigo lost nearly three-quarters (139) of its 2012 electors: three-fifths of them to voter attrition (those voters who for whatever reason didn’t show up in 2022), but more turned away from Vertigo (57) than stuck with it (54). Sixteen swung behind it this year after choosing otherwise in 2012. Meanwhile 140 of its 208 votes came from new – and presumably younger – recruits to the electorate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a decade of debate about the justices of cinematic representation, I’d wondered how Hitchcock’s frayed, pessimistic thriller of estrangement would now strike people. Filtering Pygmalion myths of idealisation and exploitation through Proustian memory games – with Bernard Herrmann’s score adding top notes of Wagnerian tragedy – it’s hardly a film that promises hope or amelioration, more a darkly, bottomlessly reflexive portrait of private vices and compulsions; a vortex of perspective-stretching, misdirection and disorientation; a whirlpool of obscure, consuming desire.

It was when Sight and Sound expanded the critics’ pool in 2012 that Jeanne Dielman first entered the list, at number 35; its rise to the top now is a triumph for women’s cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But perhaps the ultimate surprise goes even further: the film that collected the most votes in 2022 is made with a cinematic style and strategy closer to avantgarde than mainstream traditions and, furthermore, at just under three and a half hours, demands dedicated viewing. Although confrontational, idiosyncratic and extraordinary films have consistently appeared lower in the lists, the experimental tradition, to which Jeanne Dielman belongs, is – apart perhaps from the recent appearance of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera (1929) – absent. While it has brought this tradition to the top of the list, Jeanne Dielman is inescapably a woman’s film, consciously feminist in its turn to the avant garde. On the side of content, the film charts the breakdown of a bourgeois Belgian housewife, mother and part-time prostitute over the course of three days; on the side of form, it rigorously records her domestic routine in extended time and from a fixed camera position. In a film that, agonisingly, depicts women’s oppression, Akerman transforms cinema, itself so often an instrument of women’s oppression, into a liberating force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Read the <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/polls/greatest-film-all-time-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles\">full article by Laura Mulvey</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for Jeanne Dielman in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Chantal Akerman","producer":"Evelyne Paul, Corinne Jenart","writer":"Chantal Akerman","featuring":"Delphine Seyrig, Jan Decorte, Henri Storck"},"year":"1975","nameAndYear":"Jeanne Dielman  23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)","links":{"player":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles-1975-online","southbank":""},"player":{"url":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles-1975-online","cta":"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscribe/15785","pillar":"subscription","price":0,"duration":0},"performances":[],"channels":["BFI Player"],"productionCountries":"Belgium, France","runningTime":201,"sightAndSound":{"results":[]}}},{"rank":4,"tied":true,"film":{"uuid":"65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383","image":{"base":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/","relative":"2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","main":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/1920/1080/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","thumb":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/960/540/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","preload":"https://core-cms.bfi.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/96/54/1/2020-08/tokyo-story-1953-setsuko-hara-chishu-ryu.jpg","altText":null},"name":"Tokyo Story","url":"/film/65edaa59-6546-57b5-9fa3-9409f93d1383/tokyo-story","summary":{"text":"Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.","html":"<p>Told in Yasujirō Ozu’s simple and elegant style, this story of intergenerational discord is heartbreaking and deeply human.</p>\r\n"},"fullDescription":"<p>The later films of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu are marked by a striking uniformity of theme and form. These are stories of family life involving inevitable rupture, as things change, daughters marry, widowers grow old. Ozu films this bittersweet natural progression in his unmistakably controlled, minimal style, typified by head-on shots with the camera at the height of a seated observer. Tokyo Story is the best known (in the West) of this extraordinary cycle, a quietly tragic tale of an ageing couple coming to the painful realisation that their family no longer needs them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luminous Ozu regular Setsuko Hara plays daughter-in-law Noriko. Alhough not the same character as the Norikos she plays in Late Spring (1949) and Early Summer (1951), the films are considered a loose trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A brilliant film on generational change, a society in transition and what it means to feel you are no longer needed. Ozu is always the filmmaker to turn to if you want to see how to do more with less – the filmmaker of the quotidian, melding economy and intensity to extraordinary effect.” <strong>Maria Delgado</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The evocative power of this film remains intact. The soft melancholy, the passage of time, the understanding of life as a spiritual adventure. All from the adventures and misadventures of a family. So simple, so complex.” <strong>Pedro Adrián Zuluaga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A profound film. Ozu’s Zen style at its simplest and most sublime.” <strong>Patrick McGilligan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film full of wisdom, understanding and acceptance of life that never ceases to move and amaze. A beautiful heartbreak of a movie.” <strong>José Arroyo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A psychologically healing film, a magically calming one.” <strong>Saleem Albeik</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This extraordinary study of ageing, mortality and family life (among other things) has that unforgettable moment: ‘Isn’t life disappointing?’ – ‘Yes’ (with a smile).” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Its reputation for greatness is beyond deserved but canonisation also risks smothering its still live charge, pinning behind glass a work of art that still has the power to astonish, disrupt and shatter. Few works have ever been as capable of expressing the exquisite beauty and prevailing intolerability of living.” <strong>Eric Hynes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Poignancy, regret and sadness come through all the keener by virtue of the restraint of performance, composition and editing.” <strong>Richard Dyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film brimming with restrained emotion, which is unleashed through a level of unparalleled film craftsmanship. The model on which many of the world’s greatest films are based.” <strong>Akira Mizuta Lippit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ozu’s films always feel deceptively simple, despite their unusual framing and editing structures. It’s not just his mastery of cinema as a form that’s so impressive but the sheer humanity and compassion with which he manages to fill his films.” <strong>David Morrison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A gently tragic film about the wheel turning.” <strong>Tom Ryan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As you watch, it seems nothing is happening.

Hollywood movies are an artform and a mass entertainment, the product of a singular vision and of a ruthless industry, the work of great directors and the alchemical result of a thousand collaborations, coincidences and backsagainst- the-wall snap decisions. The Godfather is all of the above and more – an unimaginably dark story that begins with the hopeful sentence “I believe in America,” a fat, full saga that, two years after its release, revealed itself to be merely the middle of a fatter, fuller saga, and a work the creation of which has generated its own mythic origin stories, from the director who wouldn’t compromise to the leading man nobody was sure could pull it off. It is enduring and defining art, alchemically transmuted from the pages of an OK bestseller and the imaginations of everyone involved, first among them its great co-writer and director Francis Ford Coppola. As James Caan’s Sonny Corleone says in one of the film’s most enduring scenes, “This is business, and this man is takin’ it very, very personal.” So much of the most brilliant work from Hollywood emerged from the conviction that a movie could be both. Every scene of The Godfather makes the case for that belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie exists on countless timelines – it was an early peak for its director, given his big studio shot at the unimaginable age of 32; a mind-blowing return to form for Marlon Brando; a stunning launch for Al Pacino; a benchmark achievement of New Hollywood; and a gauntlet thrown down by its cinematographer Gordon Willis, whose brown-black-and-blacker lighting and compositions changed the look of movies. Its most experienced actor made his debut in the 1930s; its newcomers are still working today. While no movie can be said to gather both the past and the future of filmmaking into itself, The Godfather comes thrillingly close. It’s a crime story, a family story that plunders the word ‘family’ for comedy, emotion and profound horror, an immigrant story and a cautionary tale about the American hunger for power; it contains multitudes. Were the screen suddenly to triple in size, as it does in Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon (a film Coppola reveres), you sense that a teeming world would reveal itself as always having been there. But the world within Coppola’s frame is big enough; half a century later, we can still walk around in it and discover something new about moviemaking and life with every visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Harris</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out who voted for The Godfather in Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time poll soon.</p>\r\n","quote":null,"credits":{"director":"Francis Ford Coppola","producer":"Albert S.

Charting the rise of Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles himself) – who decides to start a newspaper with his inherited fortune – Welles’ film is a classic story of the corrupting effects of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of deep-focus photography (keeping both foreground and background in focus) and abstracted camera angles, the non-chronological narrative structure and overlapping dialogue, were just some of the myriad formal innovations that Welles brought together for his groundbreaking debut. Such novelty and controversy proved a curse for Welles, whose career never enjoyed such indulgence again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Citizen Kane remains the ultimate commentary on American culture since the early 20th century. It conveys America’s inherent polarities (individualism vs collective impulses; libertarianism vs puritanism; innocence vs corruption; the underdog mentality to rebel against oppression vs the impulse to rule over the masses through duping strategies) via a deft synergy of form and content. It has never been more rewarding to screen and talk about this film than in our current political moment.” <strong>Roy Grundmann</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The former champion still feels like a grand summation of film’s early development as an artform and a glimpse of the future, too. At the same time, it’s a hugely entertaining portrait of the media narcissism and demagoguery that underscore American politics.” <strong>Scott Tobias</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It still amazes for its formal bravado, a barrage of cinematographic strategies which retain their innovative resonances. The film’s reputation as representing the apogee of an ossified ‘canon’ of outstanding films should not minimise its qualities – it deserves to be so recognised. It combines the restless energy of its subject with formal experimentation which demonstrates the artistry of filmmaking as a collaborative enterprise when new technical approaches were being explored.” <strong>Sarah Street</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sadly, it’s fashionable now to chip away at its greatness. This temptation should be resisted. The audacious American masterpiece of the 20th century, not only for its cinematic innovations and storytelling vigour, but for how accurately it dissects the ‘American character’.” <strong>Eddie Muller</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What else is there to say about Kane?

Welles’s film is a twisted pearl – glorious, florid, overweening – about crazed ambition and the virtues and innocences it crushes in its wake.” <strong>Nigel Andrews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A film that amply rewards repeated viewings, revealing new depths, new nuanced details, new mysteries. There is no greatest film, but if there were, for me this would surely be the strongest contender.” <strong>Geoff Andrew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What, I’m going to leave this off, so I can look more like a wild individualist?

A ‘match cut’ which quickly replaces a bone thrown upwards by an ape with a similarly shaped spaceship floating through space, thereby compressing millennia of human evolution, is justly celebrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“‘If Kubrick could get rid of the human element, he could make the perfect film,’ joked Malcolm McDowell. But here, he almost does. By acting, arrogantly, as if nobody had ever made a really good science-fiction film before, Kubrick solves all the genre’s problems methodically but also pushes it into epic, mythic, spiritual terrain. It’s stately, bold, astonishingly beautiful. The great rationalist suddenly blasts us off into a psychedelic experience which doesn’t yield fully to reason. It’s not even certain if the film is optimistic or despairing (yet colourful).” <strong>David Cairns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Kubrick’s epic contemplation on the nature and origins of humanity remains one of cinema’s greatest technical feats, and one of its most poetic and awe-inspiring.” <strong>Stuart Brown</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Human evolution, both physical and spiritual, translated into confoundingly hypnotic imagery.” <strong>Alan Mattli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“2001: A Space Odyssey created a vocabulary from a vacuum; there was nothing like it before or after.
